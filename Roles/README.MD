# Roles - Ansible

A role enables the sharing and reuse of Ansible tasks. It contains Ansible playbook tasks, plus all the supporting files, variables, templates, and handlers needed to run the tasks. A role is a complete unit of automation that can be reused and shared. [Ref](https://galaxy.ansible.com/docs/finding/content_types.html#ansible-roles)

## Create Roles

```console
ansible-galaxy init test-role-1
```
